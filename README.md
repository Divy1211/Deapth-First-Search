# Maze Gen (DFS and recursive backtracking)
1. I have coded a DFS recursive backtracking based maze generator program in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisites
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

When you run the program it starts generationg a maze.
You can change the size of the maze by changing width and height variables in the program.
